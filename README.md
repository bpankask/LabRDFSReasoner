### Contributers:
Brayden Pankaskie

### Purpose:
This RDFS reasoner was designed to be as custamizable, scalable, and simple to understand as possible.  It was also built to be combined and used in other research areas such as Machine Learning. 

### Functions and Features:
    * Accept and parse linked data of diverse rdf syntax and ontologies, storing then as a querable graph.
    * Convert linked data to desired syntax.  (Turtle, N-Triples, NQuads, TriG, JSON-LD, RDF/XML, RDF/JSON, TriX, RDF Binary)
    * Reason over linked data using comletely customized rule set in forward, backward, or hibrid chaining.
    * Create an accurate graph which is a full RDFS entailment from the original linked data based on every guidline from the official W3C website https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-mt/#rules .
