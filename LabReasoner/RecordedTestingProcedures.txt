1. Tested each rule individually for:
	what should trigger the rule
	what should not trigger the rule
	replaced the subject, predicate, and object
2. Combined rules in the following order:
	rdfs1andlg, 2, 3, 4a, 4b, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, rdf2andlg, and rdf1
	Small changes were made during this stage to ensure that the same blank nodes were being used for both triples
	added in rules rdf2 and rdfs1

Steps one and two were tested with custom created Jena graphs  

3. The complete rule-set was then tested on a small ontology not created specifically for testing purposes to make sure the previous graphs tested
were not too specific or cooked up. - https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sample-dataset-9d5f3/resource/aca8d047-9743-4e50-b2fd-be4bd75f240e - link to small ontology used

4. The complete rule-set was then tested on a more diverse ontology of about the same size. - https://data.epo.org/linked-data/download/vocabularies/ipcOnt.ttl - 

5. The ontology from step 4 was then altered to activate more rules.

6. Added rdf and rdfs axiomatic triples then tested LabReasoner vs Jena rdfs full reasoner.  Some differences were noted but 
   they were because the Jena reasoner hadn't implemented something the LabReasoner had.  Note this test was without blank node and literal
   rules because Jena does not use them. Testing included an altered version of this file -https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/sample-dataset-9d5f3/resource/aca8d047-9743-4e50-b2fd-be4bd75f240e-
   as well as these:

7. Blank node and literal rules were then turned on and tested with many of the same files but many more were included.
